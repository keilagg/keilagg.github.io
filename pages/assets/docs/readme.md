# Ford GoBike System Data
## by Keila González-Gómez


## Dataset

> This dataset contains observations from the regional public bicycle sharing system of San Francisco Bay Area. This system is called Bay Wheels. It holds almost half million entries with variables describing the trips of the last months of 2017. 
The descriptive table originally contained 13 variables with information regarding the duration of the trip (with start and end time), the user type, the start and end stations of the trip and their respective coordinates. From these 13 columns, 4 more variables were extracted in order better comprehend the relationship between variables. These were the transformation of durations from seconds to minutes, the obtention of the trip’s length (making use of their coordinates) and the months when trips were made (extracted from the start time column). Most variables are numeric but do not possess numerical characteristics as they are identifiers of bikes, trips and stations.


## Summary of Findings
The main findings I could say I have obtained from this analysis were:
> Length and duration depicted a log-log linear relationship.
> Separating trips by duration did provide insights when plotted together with the type of customer,
> The type of customer had less impact on the length and duration than what I thought.
> The months did not have as much impact as I thought they would.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> First the relationship between duration and length as I thought it would be linear without the need for log scaling. The way each type of customer performs depending on the length of the trip. These graphs will be improved in legibility and placed in the presentation.
