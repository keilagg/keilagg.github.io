I am a PhD candidate at Universidad Politécnica de Madrid (UPM). I have bachelor's Degree in Civil Engineering and a master’s in Geodesy and Cartography. 
My current research with the UPM focuses on geospatial technologies and their usage to perform road safety analyses, specifically sight distance estimations on existing roads with particular attention to vulnerable road users (e-scooter and e-bike users, cyclists, pedestrians).

My research with Universidad Autónoma de Santo Domingo (UASD) reviews the advantages that volunteered geographic information (VGI) could bring to our many mobility challenges.
